## 🌼 Project Description

**Garden Community** is a full-stack gardening-focused web application that empowers gardeners to connect and grow together. Gardeners can register, log in, and share their personal gardening experiences and tips with others in the community. Each user has the ability to post, edit, and delete their own tips — contributing valuable knowledge to help others thrive in their gardening journey.

This app is built using **React** for the frontend, styled with **TailwindCSS** and **DaisyUI**, and powered by a **Node.js + Express.js backend** with **MongoDB** as the database. **Firebase** handles authentication and deployment. It’s a great project for learning full-stack development and building a practical, user-driven platform.
